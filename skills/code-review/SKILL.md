# Code Review

A second model reviews the change; you are the judge of its findings. The reviewer runs as a **child agent** through T3 Code's orchestration tools (`orchestrator_capabilities`, `delegate_task`), on **GPT-6.1 Sol** with **high** reasoning. A different model catches what the author's model is blind to, and your triage catches what the reviewer gets wrong.

This skill needs T3 Code's orchestration tools. If they are unavailable, say so and stop: do not fall back to a same-model subagent or to reviewing it yourself.

## 1. Resolve the reviewer

Call `orchestrator_capabilities` (search `gpt-6.1-sol`) and list the provider instances that offer GPT-6.1 Sol and can run a child task.

- **Provider named at invocation** (for example `/code-review codex_soraunion`): use it. If it does not offer GPT-6.1 Sol, say so and ask for another; never switch the model.
- **No provider named**: ask the user to pick one of the listed instances. Show each with its model id. Wait for the answer.

From the chosen provider's entry, take the exact model id (for example `gpt-6.1-sol` or `openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) and its reasoning option id (for example `reasoningEffort` or `variant`). Set that option to `high`. Do not change any other option.

## 2. Pin the change

The fixed point is what the user named (a branch, tag, commit, or `HEAD~n`); otherwise use the merge-base with the default branch, and state which you chose.

The change is everything since the merge-base, **including uncommitted work**, because `implement` leaves its work uncommitted:

- `git diff <merge-base>` for tracked changes, committed or not.
- `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` for new untracked files. The reviewer reads these whole.
- `git log <merge-base>..HEAD --oneline` for the commit list.

Confirm the ref resolves and the change is not empty before going further.

## 3. Gather the sources

- **Spec**: issue references in commit messages or the branch name (fetch them through `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`), a path the user passed, or a spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` that matches the branch. If none is found, ask once; if there is none, the reviewer skips the spec axis.
- **Standards**: search the repository for every file that documents how code should be written. When `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` exists, it must be on the list.

## 4. Delegate the review

Write the task with pointers, not copies: the reviewer shares this checkout and can run the git commands and read the files itself. Paste only what it cannot reach, such as fetched issue text. The task states:

- The reviewer must not modify the checkout; another agent verifies and fixes its findings.
- The change from step 2: the diff command, the untracked files, and the commit list.
- What to look for: bugs the change introduces, with the input or state that triggers each; gaps or wrong behavior against the spec; and violations of the standards files. Skip anything tooling already enforces.
- The report format: findings only, most severe first, each with an id (`R1`, `R2`, …), severity (blocking, high, medium, low), `file:line`, the claim, the evidence, and a suggested fix.

Call `delegate_task` with:

- `task`: the task above.
- `role`: `review`; `title`: `Code review: <branch or change>`.
- `target`: the provider instance, model id, and reasoning option from step 1.
- `isolation`: `shared`. A worktree would leave out the uncommitted work under review.
- `mode`: `wait`, with `timeoutMs` of 1800000. If the wait ends before the reviewer reports, follow the `next` instruction the tool returns; do not poll.

Do not edit the checkout while the reviewer is reading it.

## 5. Triage every finding

Treat each finding as a claim to check, not an instruction. For each one, read the cited code and the surrounding context yourself, then give exactly one verdict:

- **Accept**: the defect is real and the fix belongs in this change.
- **Modify**: the defect is real, but the finding is wrong in part (location, severity, cause, or fix). Restate it correctly; the restated version is what you address.
- **Reject**: the claim is false on inspection, already handled, contradicted by a documented repository standard or the spec, or a preference with no concrete cost. Give the reason in one line.

A real issue outside this change's scope is a **Reject** with "out of scope" and a suggested follow-up. Never accept a finding on the reviewer's word alone, and never reject one without checking the code.

## 6. Address accepted findings

Fix every **Accept** and **Modify** finding, most severe first. Where a test seam exists, write a failing test that shows the defect before fixing it. Ask the user first only when a fix would change the agreed public contract, product behavior, or scope.

Rerun the checks the fixes affect. Do not commit unless the user asks.

## 7. Report

1. The reviewer: provider instance, model, reasoning level, and the fixed point.
2. A triage table: ID, title, verdict (Accept / Modify / Reject), and a one-line reason.
3. For each accepted or modified finding: what changed, with `file:line` references.
4. Checks run, as passed, failed, or not run.
5. Rejected out-of-scope findings worth a follow-up.
